# Contributing

Thank you for helping. There are two ways in. Pick the one that matches how
you like to work.

## Two ways to contribute

### 1. Propose an edit (pull request)

Change the Markdown, then open a pull request. This is the path for editors
and co-authors. See [the editor guide](docs/editor-guide.md) for the
branch → edit → PR walkthrough.

If you have never used GitHub, you can still propose an edit from the
browser. See [the author guide](docs/author-guide.md).

### 2. File an issue

If you spotted something and do not want to touch the text yourself, open an
issue. Use **Chapter feedback** for a specific passage, or **New book
proposal** to pitch a book before anyone scaffolds it.

## One chapter per pull request

A pull request should touch one chapter file (or front/back matter), plus the
book README only when the table of contents or status needs to match.

Do not bundle unrelated chapters, repo-wide reformats, or tooling changes
into a chapter PR. Changes to `reader/` are framework work, not a chapter
PR — keep them separate.

## Direct-to-main for lead authors

The people named as authors on a book's README may commit directly to `main`
for that book — small fixes should not need ceremony. Everyone else uses a
pull request.

If you are a lead author editing someone else's book, still open a PR.

## Review expectations

- Reviews happen as line comments on the manuscript, not as a separate essay.
- Preserve the author's voice. Fix what was asked; do not rewrite the page.
- The lead author of that book merges.
- Check that the book README's contents list and status still match reality
  before merging.

## Keeping the issue dropdown current

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/chapter-feedback.yml` has a **Book** dropdown. When
you add a book, add its slug as a new option on that list in the same PR that
introduces `books/<slug>/`. Details are in [the editor guide](docs/editor-guide.md).
